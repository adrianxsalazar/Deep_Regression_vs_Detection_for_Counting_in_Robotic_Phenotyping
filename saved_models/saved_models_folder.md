# Information about the saved models folder.

In the subfolder within this folder, we will save the models/checkpoints
resulting from the training processes of our models.

Here we have three folders; one per each of the approaches used in the paper.
If nothing is modified, the saved models of each of the folder will be stored
automatically in the corresponding folders.
